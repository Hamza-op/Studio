## Technical Details

### Loading System
- Uses Lottie for high-quality vector animations
- Implements a cache manager for resource preloading
- Service Worker for offline functionality
- Minimum 2-second loading time for smooth transitions

### Animation System
- Hardware-accelerated 3D transforms
- Efficient requestAnimationFrame usage
- Optimized for performance
- Clean animation cleanup

### Caching System
- Service Worker based caching
- Resource preloading
- Offline functionality
- Automatic cache updates

## Browser Support
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)

## Performance Considerations
- All animations are optimized for 60fps
- Resources are cached for faster subsequent loads
- Smooth transitions between states
- Efficient memory management
- Hardware acceleration where possible

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser
- Local web server for testing

### Running Locally
1. Clone the repository
2. Serve the files using a local web server
3. Open `index.html` in your browser

### Making Changes
- CSS changes: Update relevant files in `/css`
- JS changes: Update relevant files in `/js`
- Loading animation: Modify Lottie animation in `loader.js`

## Best Practices
- Use `will-change` sparingly
- Implement proper cleanup for animations
- Follow modular code structure
- Maintain clean and documented code
- Test across different devices and browsers

## Future Improvements
- Add more interactive elements
- Enhance offline capabilities
- Implement dynamic content loading
- Add more animation variations
- Further performance optimizations
